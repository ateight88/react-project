Local server instructions...

Make sure you have a local server process running for mongo using the terminal command mongod
Then in a new tab in terminal run mongosh to run the shell
Type show dbs to see all local databases


Once you clone the server folder, cd into the root and run the following:
npm install
npm run seeds
npm run server:dev


to test the api calls you can do this in the browser or in Insomnia of Thunder Client in VSCode...
I've included screenshots for you to reference
